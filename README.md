# Show Imgur Images Button on Reddit - Fixed
Adds a tab to the top tabmenu called "view images" that expands links to images. Special thanks to [drowsap](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9ydts/anybody_else_ready_for_another_redditor_picture/c0f0ltr) & Richard Lainchbury from which this script was adapted. Good alternative to [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/). Best combined with autopager. - [Source](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/67729) - [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20141019170728/http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/67729)
